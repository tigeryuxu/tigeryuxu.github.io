It has been an inspiring week at [Princeton ML Theory Summer School](https://mlschool.princeton.edu/)! Thanks to [Boris Hanin](https://hanin.princeton.edu/) and [ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) for having us; to Nati Srebro, Sebastien Bubeck, Soledad Villar, and Tengyu Ma for their great lectures. Cannot wait to see what [these great researchers](https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2022/07/12/machine-learning-theory-summer-school-fosters-research-community-fast-growing-field) will achieve!

Due to their small size and high density, synapses are difficult to resolve in vivo, limiting our ability to directly relate receptor dynamics to animal behavior. Here we developed a combination of computational and biological methods to overcome these challenges. First, we trained a deep-learning image-restoration algorithm that combines the advantages of ex vivo super-resolution and in vivo imaging modalities to overcome limitations specific to each optical system. When applied to in vivo images from transgenic mice expressing fluorescently labeled glutamate receptors, this restoration algorithm super-resolved synapses, enabling the tracking of behavior-associated synaptic plasticity with high spatial resolution.

As oligodendrogenesis continues in the adult brain and is essential for myelin repair, uncovering the factors that control their dynamics is necessary to understand the consequences of adaptive myelination and develop new strategies to enhance remyelination in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, few methods exist for analysis of oligodendrocyte dynamics, and even fewer are suitable for \textlessitalic\textgreaterin vivo\textless/italic\textgreater investigation. Here, we describe the development of a fully automated cell tracking pipeline using convolutional neural networks (\textlessitalic\textgreaterOligo-Track\textless/italic\textgreater) that provides rapid volumetric segmentation and tracking of thousands of cells over weeks \textlessitalic\textgreaterin vivo\textless/italic\textgreater. This system reliably replicated human analysis, outperformed traditional analytic approaches, and extracted injury and repair dynamics at multiple cortical depths, establishing that oligodendrogenesis after cuprizone-mediated demyelination is suppressed in deeper cortical layers. Volumetric data provided by this analysis revealed that oligodendrocyte soma size progressively decreases after their generation, and declines further prior to death, providing a means to predict cell age and eventual cell death from individual time points. This new CNN-based analysis pipeline offers a rapid, robust method to quantitatively analyze oligodendrocyte dynamics \textlessitalic\textgreaterin vivo\textless/italic\textgreater, which will aid in understanding how changes in these myelinating cells influence circuit function and recovery from injury and disease.\textless/p\textgreater</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <div class="published-date">2019</div> <abbr class="badge">Comms</abbr> </div> <div id="xu_deep_2019" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0356-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep learning for high-throughput quantification of oligodendrocyte ensheathment at single-cell resolution</a></div> <div class="author"> <em>Xu, Y.</em>, Chitsaz, D., Brown, R., Cui, Q., Dabarno, M., Antel, J., and Kennedy, T. </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" style="margin-left:0">Abstract</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>High-throughput quantification of oligodendrocyte myelination is a challenge that, if addressed, would facilitate the development of therapeutics to promote myelin protection and repair.

The heuristic approach was developed by modeling general characteristics of oligodendrocyte ensheathments, while the deep learning neural network employed a UNet architecture and a single-cell training method to associate ensheathed segments with individual oligodendrocytes. Reliable extraction of multiple morphological parameters from individual cells, without heuristic approximations, allowed the UNet to match the accuracy of expert-human measurements.

Here, we describe a method to robustly convert human fibroblasts directly into oligodendrocyte-like cells (dc-hiOLs), which allows evaluation of remyelination-promoting compounds and disease modeling. Ectopic expression of SOX10, OLIG2, and NKX6.2 in human fibroblasts results in rapid generation of O4+ cells, which further differentiate into MBP+ mature oligodendrocyte-like cells within 16 days. dc-hiOLs undergo chromatin remodeling to express oligodendrocyte markers, ensheath axons, and nanofibers in vitro, respond to promyelination compound treatment, and recapitulate in vitro oligodendroglial pathologies associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher leukodystrophy related to PLP1 mutations. Furthermore, DNA methylome analysis provides evidence that the CpG methylation pattern significantly differs between dc-hiOLs derived from fibroblasts of young and old donors, indicating the maintenance of the source cells’ “age.” In summary, dc-hiOLs represent a reproducible technology that could contribute to personalized medicine in the field of myelin diseases., • SOX10, OLIG2, and NKX6.2 directly convert human fibroblasts into dc-hiOLs in 16 days • dc-hiOLs express key oligodendrocyte markers • dc-hiOLs preserve the epigenetic age of donor cells • dc-hiOLs from PMD patients show maturation deficit and vulnerability to cell death , In this article, Kuhlmann and colleagues show that human fibroblasts can be directly converted into oligodendrocyte-like cells (dc-hiOLs) upon overexpression of SOX10, OLIG2, and NKX6.2. dc-hiOLs undergo chromatin remodeling to activate oligodendrocyte-related genes, perform ensheathment in vitro, and maintain the epigenetic age of donor cells.

Promotion of remyelination, an endogenous repair mechanism resulting in the formation of new myelin sheaths around demyelinated axons, represents a promising new treatment approach. However, remyelination frequently fails in MS lesions, which can in part be attributed to impaired differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes. The reasons for impaired oligodendroglial differentiation and defective remyelination in MS are currently unknown. To determine whether intrinsic oligodendroglial factors contribute to impaired remyelination in relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), we compared induced pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes (hiOL) from RRMS patients and controls, among them two monozygous twin pairs discordant for MS. We found that hiOL from RRMS patients and controls were virtually indistinguishable with respect to remyelination-associated functions and proteomic composition. However, while analyzing the effect of extrinsic factors we discovered that supernatants of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) significantly inhibit oligodendroglial differentiation. In particular, we identified CD4+ T cells as mediators of impaired oligodendroglial differentiation; at least partly due to interferon-gamma secretion. Additionally, we observed that blocked oligodendroglial differentiation induced by PBMC supernatants could not be restored by application of oligodendroglial differentiation promoting drugs, whereas treatment of PBMCs with the immunomodulatory drug teriflunomide prior to supernatant collection partly rescued oligodendroglial differentiation. In summary, these data indicate that the oligodendroglial differentiation block is not due to intrinsic oligodendroglial factors but rather caused by the inflammatory environment in RRMS lesions which underlines the need for drug screening approaches taking the inflammatory environment into account. Combined, these findings may contribute to the development of new remyelination promoting strategies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <div class="published-date">2020</div> <abbr class="badge">PLOS</abbr> </div> <div id="cui_effects_2020" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title"><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Biotin on survival, ensheathment, and ATP production by oligodendrocyte lineage cells in vitro</a></div> <div class="author">Cui, Q., Lin, Y.,  <em>Xu, Y.</em>, Fernandes, M., Rao, V., Kennedy, T., and Antel, J. </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" style="margin-left:0">Abstract</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Mechanisms implicated in disease progression in multiple sclerosis include continued oligodendrocyte (OL)/myelin injury and failure of myelin repair. Underlying causes include metabolic stress with resultant energy deficiency. Biotin is a cofactor for carboxylases involved in ATP production that impact myelin production by promoting fatty acid synthesis. Here, we investigate the effects of high dose Biotin (MD1003) on the functional properties of post-natal rat derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). A2B5 positive OPCs were assessed using an in vitro injury assay, culturing cells in either DFM (DMEM/F12+N1) or “stress media” (no glucose (NG)-DMEM), with Biotin added over a range from 2.5 to 250 μg/ml, and cell viability determined after 24 hrs. Biotin reduced the increase in OPC cell death in the NG condition. In nanofiber myelination assays, biotin increased the percentage of ensheathing cells, the number of ensheathed segments per cell, and length of ensheathed segments. In dispersed cell culture, Biotin also significantly increased ATP production, assessed using a Seahorse bio-analyzer. For most assays, the positive effects of Biotin were observed at the higher end of the dose-response analysis. We conclude that Biotin, in vitro, protects OL lineage cells from metabolic injury, enhances myelin-like ensheathment, and is associated with increased ATP production.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <div class="published-date">2020</div> <abbr class="badge">SciAdv</abbr> </div> <div id="mozafari_multiple_2020" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title"><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc6983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple sclerosis iPS-derived oligodendroglia conserve their properties to functionally interact with axons and glia in vivo</a></div> <div class="author">Mozafari, S., Starost, L., Manot-Saillet, B., Garcia-Diaz, B.,  <em>Xu, Y.</em>, Roussel, D., Levy, M., Ottoboni, L., Kim, K., Schöler, H., Kennedy, T., Antel, J., Martino, G., Angulo, M., Kuhlmann, T., and Baron-Van Evercooren, A. </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" style="margin-left:0">Abstract</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Remyelination failure in multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with a migration/differentiation block of oligodendroglia. The reason for this block is highly debated. It could result from disease-related extrinsic or intrinsic regulators in oligodendroglial biology. To avoid confounding immune-mediated extrinsic effect, we used an immune-deficient mouse model to compare induced pluripotent stem cell–derived oligodendroglia from MS and healthy donors following engraftment in the developing CNS. We show that the MS-progeny behaves and differentiates into oligodendrocytes to the same extent as controls. They generate equal amounts of myelin, with bona fide nodes of Ranvier, and promote equal restoration of their host slow conduction. MS-progeny expressed oligodendrocyte- and astrocyte-specific connexins and established functional connections with donor and host glia. Thus, MS oligodendroglia, regardless of major immune manipulators, are intrinsically capable of myelination and making functional axo-glia/glia-glia connections, reinforcing the view that the MS oligodendrocyte differentiation block is not from major intrinsic oligodendroglial deficits.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <div class="published-date">2019</div> <abbr class="badge">PNAS</abbr> </div> <div id="kremer_pherv-w_2019" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title"><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1901283116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pHERV-W envelope protein fuels microglial cell-dependent damage of myelinated axons in multiple sclerosis</a></div> <div class="author">Kremer, D., Gruchot, J., Weyers, V., Oldemeier, L., Göttle, P., Healy, L., Ho Jang, J., Kang T.

Myeloid cells such as brain-resident microglia and blood-borne monocytes are thought to be critically involved in this degenerative process. However, the exact underlying mechanisms have still not been clarified. We have previously demonstrated that human endogenous retrovirus type W (HERV-W) negatively affects oligodendroglial precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and remyelination via its envelope protein pathogenic HERV-W (pHERV-W) ENV (formerly MS-associated retrovirus [MSRV]-ENV). In this current study, we investigated whether pHERV-W ENV also plays a role in axonal injury in MS. We found that in MS lesions, pHERV-W ENV is present in myeloid cells associated with axons. Focusing on progressive disease stages, we could then demonstrate that pHERV-W ENV induces a degenerative phenotype in microglial cells, driving them toward a close spatial association with myelinated axons. Moreover, in pHERV-W ENV-stimulated myelinated cocultures, microglia were found to structurally damage myelinated axons. Taken together, our data suggest that pHERV-W ENV-mediated microglial polarization contributes to neurodegeneration in MS.

I am a PhD student and [Kavli NDI Distinguished graduate fellow](https://kavlijhu.org/initiatives/awards) in the Solomon H. Snyder Department of Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where I am advised by [Dwight Bergles](https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/6) and [Jeremias Sulam](https://sites.google.com/view/jsulam). 

Prior to Johns Hopkins, I obtained my B.Sc. in Physiology at McGill University in Montreal, and completed my honors thesis in the lab of [Jack Antel](https://www.mcgill.ca/neurology-neurosurgery/jack-p-antel-md), devising high-throughput drug-screening pipelines to identify therapeutics for multiple sclerosis.

My current research focuses on:

- Whole-brain mapping of oligodendrocyte patterns check out some cool [videos](https://vimeo.com/1003497448?ts=0&share=copy),
- Uncovering the relationship between brain vasculature and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells,
- Examining the mechanisms of nodal plasticity *in vivo*,
- Building computational pipelines and deep learning algorithms for cell tracing and tracking,

Outside the lab, I am a casual musician and eager supporter of the performing arts, co-founding a production company, [Two Gents of New West](https://twogentsnw.weebly.com/), that aims to help young aspiring artists by giving a voice to innovative new stories and projects.

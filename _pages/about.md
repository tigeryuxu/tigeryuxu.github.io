I am a PhD student and [Kavli NDI Distinguished graduate fellow](https://kavlijhu.org/initiatives/awards) in the Solomon H. Snyder Department of Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where I am advised by [Dwight Bergles](https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/6) and [Jeremias Sulam](https://sites.google.com/view/jsulam). 

Prior to Johns Hopkins, I obtained my B.Sc. in Physiology at McGill University in Montreal, and completed my honors thesis in the lab of [Jack Antel](https://www.mcgill.ca/neurology-neurosurgery/jack-p-antel-md), devising high-throughput drug-screening pipelines to identify therapeutics for multiple sclerosis.

My current research focuses on:

- Whole-brain mapping of oligodendrocyte patterns (check out some cool [videos](https://vimeo.com/1003497448?ts=0&share=copy) and [data](https://neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!%7B%22dimensions%22:%7B%22x%22:%5B0.000001152035240378141%2C%22m%22%5D%2C%22y%22:%5B0.000001152035240378141%2C%22m%22%5D%2C%22z%22:%5B0.000005%2C%22m%22%5D%7D%2C%22position%22:%5B5165.2958984375%2C5149.51025390625%2C-1048.5%5D%2C%22crossSectionScale%22:5.473947391727203%2C%22projectionScale%22:16384%2C%22layers%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22image%22%2C%22source%22:%7B%22url%22:%22n5://https://xu-bergles-oligo-maps.s3.amazonaws.com/M260_MoE_P60/setup0/timepoint0/%22%2C%22transform%22:%7B%22matrix%22:%5B%5B1%2C0%2C0%2C0%5D%2C%5B0%2C1%2C0%2C0%5D%2C%5B0%2C0%2C-1%2C0%5D%5D%2C%22outputDimensions%22:%7B%22x%22:%5B0.000001152035240378141%2C%22m%22%5D%2C%22y%22:%5B0.000001152035240378141%2C%22m%22%5D%2C%22z%22:%5B0.000005%2C%22m%22%5D%7D%7D%7D%2C%22tab%22:%22source%22%2C%22shaderControls%22:%7B%22normalized%22:%7B%22range%22:%5B0%2C1102%5D%7D%7D%2C%22name%22:%22timepoint0%22%7D%5D%2C%22selectedLayer%22:%7B%22size%22:309%2C%22visible%22:true%2C%22layer%22:%22timepoint0%22%7D%2C%22layout%22:%22xy%22%7D)),
- Uncovering the relationship between brain vasculature and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells,
- Examining the mechanisms of nodal plasticity *in vivo*,
- Building computational pipelines and deep learning algorithms for cell tracing and tracking,

Outside the lab, I am a casual musician and eager supporter of the performing arts, co-founding a production company, [Two Gents of New West](https://twogentsnw.weebly.com/), that aims to help young aspiring artists by giving a voice to innovative new stories and projects.
